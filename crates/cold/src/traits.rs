/// Unified cold storage backend trait.
///
/// Backend is responsible for all data organization, indexing, and keying.
/// The trait is agnostic to how the backend stores or indexes data.
///
/// All methods are async and return futures that are `Send`.
///
/// # Implementation Guide
///
/// Implementers must ensure:
///
/// - **Append-only ordering**: `append_block` must enforce monotonically
///   increasing block numbers. Attempting to append a block with a number <=
///   the current latest should return an error.
///
/// - **Atomic truncation**: `truncate_above` must remove all data for blocks
///   N+1 and higher atomically. Partial truncation is not acceptable.
///
/// - **Index maintenance**: Hash-based lookups (e.g., header by hash,
///   transaction by hash) require the implementation to maintain appropriate
///   indexes. These indexes must be updated during `append_block` and cleaned
///   during `truncate_above`.
///
/// - **Consistent reads**: Read operations should return consistent snapshots.
///   A read started before a write completes should not see partial data from
///   that write.
///
/// - **Tag resolution**: `HeaderSpecifier::Tag` variants (Latest, Finalized,
///   Safe, Earliest) must be resolved by the implementation. For simple
///   backends, Latest/Finalized/Safe may all resolve to the same block.
